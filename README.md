# Legendary Encounters: Alien tools

An automated game setup manager for Legendary Encounters: Alien, and a crew evaluator which can either be used standalone or opened from the setup manager with settings and characters prefilled.

Please note that these pages are made for a section of the HTML code to be copy/pasted into flatpages in my [Django portfolio](https://gitlab.com/kenherbert/developer-portfolio) but are set up here as standalone pages with no requirement for Python or Django for completeness and for development purposes.

Also note that the crew & class icons are included in the repo for completeness, but the code uses absolute links to the icons in my portfolio's static files.



## More info

For more info about how things work please check out [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/kenherbert/legendary-encounters-alien-setup-manager/-/wikis/home).


## Future plans
- Add more comparison points for characters in the crew evaluator
- Test/fix issues with touch controls
